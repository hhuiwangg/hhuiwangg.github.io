### Abstract

This paper presents a two-way coupling approach to simulate bouncing droplet phenomena by incorporating the lubricated thin aerodynamic gap between fluid volumes. At the heart of our framework lies a cut-cell representation of the thin air film between colliding liquid fluid volumes. The air pressures within the thin film, modeled using a reduced fluid model based on the lubrication theory, are coupled with the volumetric liquid pressures by the gradient across the liquid-air interfaces and solved in a monolithic two-way coupling system. Our method can accurately solve liquid-liquid interaction with air films without adaptive grid refinements, enabling accurate simulation of many novel surface-tension-driven phenomena such as droplet collisions, bouncing droplets, and promenading pairs.
